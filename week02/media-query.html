            <h2>Matthew 5:14-16</h2>
            <p>14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
                15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
                16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p>

            <h2>2 Nephi 2:27</h2>
            <p>27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man.
                 And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, 
                 or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh 
                 that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</p>
